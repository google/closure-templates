# safe-html-types

The files within this directory were directly vendored in from the
(now-archived) github repository at it's final public commit:

- <https://github.com/google/safe-html-types/commit/a0fa702c497b7e201e48b52b5adf0259f1d381ca>.

This is used to override the original maven artifact
`com.google.common.html.types:types:1.0.8`, last published in 2017.  This
artifact contains generated java protos that are no longer compatible with more
modern versions of protobuf.
