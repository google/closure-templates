/**
 * A string-like object which represents a sequence of CSS declarations ({@code propertyName1:
 * propertyvalue1; propertyName2: propertyValue2; ...}) and that carries the security type contract
 * that its value, as a string, will not cause untrusted script execution (XSS) when evaluated as
 * CSS in a browser.
 *
 * <p>A SafeStyle's string representation ({@link #getSafeStyleString()}) can safely be:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Interpolated as the content of a <b>quoted</b> HTML style attribute. However, the SafeStyle
 *       string <b>must be HTML-attribute-escaped</b> before interpolation.
 *   <li>Interpolated as the content of a {}-wrapped block within a stylesheet. '<' characters in
 *       the SafeStyle string <b>must be CSS-escaped</b> before interpolation. The SafeStyle string
 *       is also guaranteed not to be able to introduce new properties or elide existing ones.
 *   <li>Interpolated as the content of a {}-wrapped block within an HTML <style> element. '<'
 *       characters in the SafeStyle string <b>must be CSS-escaped</b> before interpolation.
 *   <li>Assigned to the style property of a DOM node. The SafeStyle string should not be escaped
 *       before being assigned to the property.
 * </ul>
 *
 * TODO(mlourenco): Do we need to require SafeStyle to be the entire content of a style attribute or
 * the {}-wrapped block above? It would seem that validating untrusted properties would be enough to
 * guarantee that it also would not affect any surrounding, constant, properties. See discussion in
 * cl/61826926.
 *
 * <p>A SafeStyle may never contain literal angle brackets. Otherwise, it could be unsafe to place a
 * SafeStyle into a &lt;style&gt; tag (where it can't be HTML escaped). For example, if the
 * SafeStyle containing "{@code font: 'foo &lt;style/&gt;&lt;script&gt;evil&lt;/script&gt;'}" were
 * interpolated within a &lt;style&gt; tag, this would then break out of the style context into
 * HTML.
 *
 * <p>A SafeStyle may contain literal single or double quotes, and as such the entire style string
 * must be escaped when used in a style attribute (if this were not the case, the string could
 * contain a matching quote that would escape from the style attribute).
 *
 * <p>Values of this type must be composable, i.e. for any two values {@code style1} and {@code
 * style2} of this type, {@code style1.getSafeStyleString() + style2.getSafeStyleString()} must
 * itself be a value that satisfies the SafeStyle type constraint. This requirement implies that for
 * any value {@code style} of this type, {@code style.getSafeStyleString()} must not end in a
 * "property value" or "property name" context. For example, a value of {@code background:url("} or
 * {@code font-} would not satisfy the SafeStyle contract. This is because concatenating such
 * strings with a second value that itself does not contain unsafe CSS can result in an overall
 * string that does. For example, if {@code javascript:evil())"} is appended to {@code
 * background:url("}, the resulting string may result in the execution of a malicious script.
 *
 * <p>TODO(mlourenco): Consider whether we should implement UTF-8 interchange-validity checks and
 * blocking of newlines (including Unicode ones) and other whitespace characters (\t, \f). Document
 * here if so and also update SafeStyles.fromConstant().
 *
 * <p>The following example values comply with this type's contract:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><code>width: 1em;</code>
 *   <li><code>height:1em;</code>
 *   <li><code>width: 1em;height: 1em;</code>
 *   <li><code>background:url('http://url');</code>
 * </ul>
 *
 * In addition, the empty string is safe for use in a CSS attribute.
 *
 * <p>The following example values do <em>not</em> comply with this type's contract:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><code>background: red</code> (missing a trailing semi-colon)
 *   <li><code>background:</code> (missing a value and a trailing semi-colon)
 *   <li><code>1em</code> (missing an attribute name, which provides context for the value)
 * </ul>
