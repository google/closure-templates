/**
 * A string-like object which represents JavaScript code and that carries the security type contract
 * that its value, as a string, will not cause execution of unconstrained attacker controlled code
 * (XSS) when evaluated as JavaScript in a browser.
 *
 * <p>A SafeScript's string representation ({@link #getSafeScriptString()}) can safely be
 * interpolated as the content of a script element within HTML. The SafeScript string should not be
 * escaped before interpolation.
 *
 * <p>Note that the SafeScript might contain text that is attacker-controlled but that text should
 * have been interpolated with appropriate escaping, sanitization and/or validation into the right
 * location in the script, such that it is highly constrained in its effect (for example, it had to
 * match a set of allowed words).
 *
 * <p>A SafeScript can be constructed via security-reviewed unchecked conversions. In this case
 * producers of SafeScript must ensure themselves that the SafeScript does not contain unsafe
 * script. Note in particular that {@code &lt;} is dangerous, even when inside JavaScript strings,
 * and so should always be forbidden or JavaScript escaped in user controlled input. For example, if
 * {@code &lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;evil&lt;/script&gt;"} were interpolated inside a JavaScript
 * string, it would break out of the context of the original script element and {@code evil} would
 * execute. Also note that within an HTML script (raw text) element, HTML character references, such
 * as {@code &amp;lt;}, are not allowed. See
 * http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#restrictions-for-contents-of-script-elements.
