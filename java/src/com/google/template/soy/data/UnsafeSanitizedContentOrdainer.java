/**
 * Restricted class to create SanitizedContent objects.
 *
 * <p>Creating a SanitizedContent object is potentially dangerous, as it means you're swearing in
 * advance the content won't cause a cross site scripting vulnerability. In the long term it is
 * nearly impossible to show that any piece of code will always produce safe content -- for example,
 * a parameter that is safe one day may be vulnerable after a refactoring that uses it in a
 * different way.
 *
 * <p>We suggest you limit your usage of this to just a few files in your code base. Create a small
 * set of utility files that generate and sanitize at the same time. Example utilities:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Serializing JSON objects from a data structure.
 *   <li>Running a sanitizer on HTML for an email message.
 *   <li>Extracting a field from a protocol message that is always run-time sanitized by a backend.
 *       It's useful to label the protocol message fields with a "SafeHtml" suffix to reinforce.
 * </ul>
