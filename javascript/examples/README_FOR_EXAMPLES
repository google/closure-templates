'javascript/examples'
This directory contains files related to using the examples from JavaScript.
For the shared examples files, see directory 'examples'.


1. Files for the simple example:

+ simple_generated.js
    The JS file generated by SoyToJsSrcCompiler when it is executed on simple.soy.
    Note: For an example Ant target (and command line args) that generates this file, please
    see target 'js-simple-example' within the top-level 'build.xml'.

+ simple-usage.js
    Hand-written JS code that uses the generated functions.

+ simple-usage.html
    Basic HTML code that ties it all together and displays the result. Note that the generated
    code requires the library 'javascript/soyutils.js'.


2. Files for the features example:

+ features-usage_globals.txt
    Compile-time globals file for the features examples. This is passed as an optional flag to
    SoyToJsSrcCompiler.

+ simple_generated_en.js, features_generated_en.js,
  simple_generated_x-zz.js, features_generated_x-zz.js
    The JS files generated by SoyToJsSrcCompiler when it is executed on simple.soy and
    features.soy (locales are 'en' and 'x-zz' with the translated XLIFF files from shared examples
    directory 'examples' and with the above compile-time globals file). We need both simple.soy and
    features.soy because some of the templates in features.soy call the templates in simple.soy.
    Note: For an example Ant target (and command line args) that generates these files, please
    see target 'js-features-example' within the top-level 'build.xml'.

+ features-usage.js
    Hand-written JS code that uses the generated functions.

+ features-usage_en.html, features-usage_x-zz.html
    Basic HTML code that ties it all together and displays the result. Note that the generated
    code requires the library 'javascript/soyutils.js'.
