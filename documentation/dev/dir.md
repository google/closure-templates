# Compiling Templates

## Invoking the compiler directly

For open source users, we release maven artifacts that are executable jars, and
users can directly invoke these binaries to compile the templates.

### Java {#java}

<!--TODO(lukes): rewrite the docs on command line flags to talk about common flags vs backend specific flags -->

Soy has 2 Java backends: `Tofu` which is an interpreter and `SoySauce` which is
a compiler.

For `Tofu` you need to use the `SoyFileSet.compileToTofu()` method at runtime,
`SoySauce` also supports a similar mode via the `SoyFileSet.compileTemplates()`
though this is discouraged since the best way is to use the
`SoyToJbcSrcCompiler` binary.

In the command line arguments to the `SoyToJbcSrcCompiler`, you must include the
paths to all of the Soy files that you want to be compiled together as one
bundle. The binary also accepts a number of command-line flags, some of which
are required.

To see all of the available command-line flags, run the binary with `--help`.

The table below lists the most important command-line flags:

| Flag                       | Usage                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `--srcs`                   | **[Required]** The list of source Soy files.   |
| `--deps`                   | The list of dependency Soy files (if           |
:                            : applicable). The compiler needs deps for       :
:                            : analysis/checking, but does not generate code  :
:                            : for dep files.                                 :
| `--indirecteDeps`          | The list of indirected dependency Soy files    |
:                            : (if applicable). The compiler needs indirect   :
:                            : deps for analysis/checking, but does not       :
:                            : generate code for dep files.                   :
| `--output`                 | **[Required]** The name of the Jar file to     |
:                            : write                                          :
| `--outputSrcJar`           | The name of a Jar file containing source files |
:                            : to write. This places the source files into a  :
:                            : directory structure that will enable some IDEs :
:                            : like eclipse to do basic line level debugging  :
:                            : of your Soy template source files              :
| `--pluginModules`          | See the section on [function or print          |
:                            : directive plugins](./plugins) in Plugins.      :

Here's an example of how the compiler might be invoked from the command line:

```shell
$ java -jar SoyToJbcSrcCompiler.jar \
           --output=soy.jar \
           --srcs=simple.soy,features.soy
```

This sample usage generates a `jar` file including the generated code for the
two source files. Place this jar on the classpath of your application to use the
generated code at runtime.

### JavaScript

JavaScript usage is supported by the Soy compiler's JavaScript Source backend.
You have two options for invoking the compiler to generate JavaScript source:
you can build and run the executable binary (more common) or you can call the
compiler from Java. This section discusses how to use both options.

#### How to build and run the executable binary

In the command line arguments to the `SoyToJsSrcCompiler`, you must include the
paths to all of the Soy files that you want to be compiled together as one
bundle. The binary also accepts a number of command-line flags, some of which
are required.

To see all of the available command-line flags, run the binary with `--help`.

The table below lists the most important command-line flags:

Flag                             | Usage
-------------------------------- | -----
`--srcs`                         | **[Required]** The list of source Soy files.
`--deps`                         | The list of dependency Soy files (if applicable). The compiler needs deps for analysis/checking, but does not generate code for dep files.
`--locales`                      | **[Required for generating localized JavaScript]** The list of locales for which to generate localized JS. Soy generates one output JS file for each combination of input Soy file and locale.
`--messageFilePathFormat`        | **[Required for generating localized JavaScript]** A format string that specifies how to build the path to each message file. The format string can include literal characters as well as the placeholders `{LOCALE}`, and `{LOCALE_LOWER_CASE}`. Note `{LOCALE_LOWER_CASE}` also turns dashes into underscores, e.g. `pt-BR` becomes `pt_br`. For most projects, this format string is of the form `/home/build/xtb/<tc_project_name>/{LOCALE}.xtb`.
`--outputPathFormat`             | **[Required]** A format string that specifies how to build the path to each output file. The format string can include literal characters as well as the placeholders `{INPUT_DIRECTORY}`, `{INPUT_FILE_NAME}`, `{INPUT_FILE_NAME_NO_EXT}`, `{LOCALE}`, `{LOCALE_LOWER_CASE}`. If you are not generating localized JavaScript, then Soy outputs one JavaScript file (encoded in UTF-8) for each input Soy file. If you are generating localized JavaScript, then Soy outputs one JavaScript file for each combination of input Soy file and locale.
`--shouldGenerateGoogMsgDefs`    | Set this flag if you want `goog.getMsg` definitions to be generated for all `msg` blocks. For more information, see the section on [Letting JS Compiler Handle Translation](localization.md#closurecompiler) in the Translation chapter.
`--bidiGlobalDir`                | **[Required if and only if generating `goog.getMsg` definitions]** For more information, see the section on [Letting JS Compiler Handle Translation](localization.md#closurecompiler) in the Translation chapter.
`--useGoogIsRtlForBidiGlobalDir` | [Only applicable if both `shouldGenerateGoogMsgDefs` is true] Set this flag to determine the bidi global direction at template render time by evaluating `goog.i18n.bidi.IS_RTL`. Do not combine with `bidiGlobalDir`.
`--googMsgsAreExternal`          | Use this flag if you want your project to use Soy to extract messages (e.g. with `SoyMsgExtractor`) but use JS Compiler to insert the translated messages. Using Soy to extract messages is recommended. If you use Soy from both Java and JavaScript, then it's essential for correctness.
`--pluginModules`                | See the section on [function or print directive plugins](./plugins) in Plugins.

Here's an example of how the compiler might be invoked from the command line:

```shell
$ java -jar SoyToJsSrcCompiler.jar \
           --locales=en,xx-YY,xx-ZZ \
           --messageFilePathFormat=/home/build/SoyExamples/{LOCALE}.xtb \
           --outputPathFormat='{INPUT_FILE_NAME}__{LOCALE_LOWER_CASE}.js' \
           --srcs=template/soy/examples/simple.soy,template/soy/examples/features.soy
```

This sample usage generates 6 total JS files in your directory â€” one for each
combination of input `.soy` file (`simple.soy`, `features.soy`) and locale
(`en`, `xx-YY`, `xx-ZZ`).
